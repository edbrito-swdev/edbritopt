<h1>Eduardo Brito - Software Developer</h1>
<p>Thanks for visiting my website. Here you can find information related to my ongoing career as a software developer/engineer, as well as links to other things that I'm working on at the moment.</p>
<p>As you can tell from this website, I try to avoid frontend work as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Websites</a> should be as minimal as possible.</strong></p>
<p>Also, <strong>IF YOU ARE A RECRUITER READ THIS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Am I looking for new job opportunities at the moment? No.</li>
<li>Will I reply to unsolicited emails? No.</li>
<li>Am I a perfect match for your company? Read the previous point.</li>
<li>Do you still want to contact me? Your call but I might* not reply.</li>
</ul>
<p>*might should be read as definitely.</p>
