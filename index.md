# Eduardo Brito - Software Developer


Thanks for visiting my website. Here you can find information related to my ongoing career as a software developer/engineer, as well as links to other things that I'm working on at the moment.


As you can tell from this website, I try to avoid frontend work as much as possible.


**[Websites](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) should be as minimal as possible.**


Also, **IF YOU ARE A RECRUITER READ THIS:**


- Am I looking for new job opportunities at the moment? No.
- Will I reply to unsolicited emails? No.
- Am I a perfect match for your company? Read the previous point.
- Do you still want to contact me? Your call but I might* not reply.


*might should be read as definitely.
